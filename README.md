## Context

UMKM (Usaha Mikro, Kecil, dan Menengah) or Small and Medium-sized Enterprises face challenges in running their businesses effectively. 
One significant challenge is the difficulty of being found online, which often leads UMKMs to rely solely on physical offline locations provided by local governments and 
depend on local customers for sales. Many UMKMs have yet to establish an online presence, missing out on a significant market opportunity, 
as online sales can attract customers from all over Indonesia. This issue arises from the lack of a centralized platform where UMKMs 
can join a system that makes them easily discoverable by potential buyers.

## Business Tasks

The objective of this project is to create a Yellow Pages-like system for UMKMs, addressing the needs of both buyers and UMKMs themselves. The system aims to enable:

1. Buyers to easily find information about UMKMs by searching for UMKM names, fields of operation, or cities.
   They can access comprehensive information about UMKMs, including the UMKM name, address, phone number, and field of operation.

2. UMKMs to connect and collaborate with each other. This integration will help facilitate interactions between UMKMs and the community,
   potentially improving the livelihoods of UMKM entrepreneurs.
   
### Key Features
- Business search by category (UMKM name, or field).
- Business search by location (city).
- Display search results with business contact information (name, address, phone number).

### Objectives
- Provide an efficient solution for local business information search.
- Assist users in finding the businesses they need in a particular area.
- Enhance user engagement by displaying business reviews and ratings.

## Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders in this project are:
1. **Masyarakat (Community):** Individuals looking for UMKM information to make purchases or collaborations.
2. **UMKM Entrepreneurs:** Small and Medium-sized Enterprises seeking an online presence and opportunities for collaboration.
3. **Developers:** The development team responsible for building, maintaining, and updating the program.
4. **Investors (if applicable):** Parties investing in the project for profit generation.

## Limitations

This project has several limitations to consider:

1. **Limited Data:** The program will use a limited set of business data provided. Actual data may change over time.
2. **No Automatic Updates:** Business information will not be updated automatically. Manual updates are required.
3. **Program Operates Locally:** The program currently operates offline or locally, without internet connectivity. However, it has the potential for significant growth if connected to the internet and assigned its own domain.
4. **Users cannot make purchases online:** The system does not include a direct e-commerce feature for buyers to make purchases from UMKMs. It primarily serves to provide UMKM location and contact information.

## Data Summary

he dataset used for this project contains information to facilitate contact with UMKMs. It consists of six columns:
**ID UMKM:** Unique IDs assigned to each UMKM.
**Nama UMKM (UMKM Name):** The name of the UMKM.
**Bidang (Field):** The field or industry in which the UMKM operates.
**Nomor Telepon (Phone Number):** The contact phone number for the UMKM.
**Alamat (Address):** The physical address of the UMKM.
**Kota (City)**: The city in which the UMKM is located.

This data will be used to create a local business database that users can search. Ensure this data is prepared before running the program.
